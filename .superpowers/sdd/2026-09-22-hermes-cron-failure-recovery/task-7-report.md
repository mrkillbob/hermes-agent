# Task 7 report — PR handoff enforcement and Hermes worktree audit

## Outcome

Implemented a fail-closed terminal receipt for dispatcher-managed Git worktrees:

- every worktree completion declares `metadata.repository_changes` as a Boolean;
- `false` is accepted only while the assigned Git checkout is clean;
- `true` requires `commit_sha`, `pushed_branch`, `repository`, `base_branch`, and `pr_url`;
- changed receipts are checked against the live 40-character HEAD, assigned/current branch, a same-head remote-tracking ref, the matching GitHub remote repository, and an ancestor remote base branch;
- rejection happens before `complete_task`, so the card remains in flight and the workspace is preserved;
- scratch tasks and non-worktree directories retain their prior completion behavior.

Worker context and the `kanban_complete` schema now describe the same receipt shape.

## Invariant coverage

Added tool-level behavior tests for:

1. committed/pushed work without a PR URL is rejected and remains running;
2. a clean exact-head pushed branch with a matching PR receipt is accepted;
3. an explicit read-only/no-change receipt is accepted without a PR;
4. a worktree completion with no change declaration is rejected;
5. worker context states both the no-change and repository-change forms.

The tests use a real temporary Git repository and bare remote. No Git behavior is mocked.

## Read-only worktree and Kanban audit

Evidence is in `docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-09-22-hermes-worktree-pr-audit.md`.

- Direct GitHub identity: `mrkillbob`.
- Registered Hermes Agent worktrees audited: 28.
- Dirty worktrees were preserved; no reset, clean, stash, commit, push, or branch rewrite was performed in them.
- Clean historical heads were covered by merged PRs #108–#124 or, for the superseded engineering-memory branch, had the same stable patch-id as the fork-base commit merged by PR #122.
- PR #125 already covers the only current open registered Hermes sync head.
- The exact unassociated heads were active/dirty WIP rather than qualifying completed changes.
- The current Kanban board had one active Hermes worktree card (`t_92e44484`), already blocked with its ephemeral path removed. Recent worktree cards were diagnostic/no-change and cleaned up. Scratch cards that named changed files had no committed Git receipt.
- No qualifying completed change required a new PR. No PR was opened and no Kanban task or receipt was mutated.

## Verification

Red evidence was observed before implementation:

- `test_complete_rejects_repository_change_without_pr_receipt` failed because the task completed instead of returning an error.
- `test_complete_rejects_worktree_without_change_declaration` failed for the same reason.
- the worker-context guidance assertion failed before the guidance changed.

Green focused command:

```text
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/tools/test_kanban_tools.py tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_core_functionality.py \
  -k 'repository_change_without_pr_receipt or exact_repository_pr_receipt or explicit_no_repository_changes or worktree_without_change_declaration or worker_context_requires_terminal_kanban_receipt'
```

Result: **5 passed, 0 failed**.

Full affected files:

```text
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/tools/test_kanban_tools.py tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_core_functionality.py
```

Result: **76 passed, 1 failed, 1 skipped**. All 47 tests in `tests/tools/test_kanban_tools.py` passed. The sole failure was the pre-existing, independently reproducible `tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_core_functionality.py::test_protocol_violation_budget_not_consumed_by_other_failures`: it expected a third protocol violation to block, but the task remained ready. A fresh isolated rerun reproduced that failure. Task 7 does not alter the protocol-violation budget or dispatcher failure handling, so it was recorded rather than expanded into this repair.

Additional checks:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `python3 -m py_compile` for every changed Python source/test file: pass.

## Preserved unrelated state

The pre-existing modification to `task-5-report.md` was not edited or staged as part of Task 7.

## Review round 1 — exact PR identity and no-change ancestry

Two fail-closed gaps were repaired after review:

- changed-work completion now resolves the declared PR number through the bundled `GitHubClient` created by `GitHubClient.for_automation_identity`; this verifies the dedicated Hermes GitHub viewer before reading the canonical PR;
- the canonical PR must be open in the declared base repository, with the exact receipt head branch, head SHA, and base branch;
- missing or malformed GitHub data, including a nonexistent PR, leaves the task in flight;
- the worktree allocator records the assigned base ref and immutable base SHA, and the dispatcher copies them into control-plane task fields before spawning the worker;
- a `repository_changes=false` receipt now requires the clean worktree HEAD to equal that assigned base SHA, so a clean committed branch cannot bypass the PR receipt.

The completion helper accepts injected Git and GitHub clients for invariant tests. Production calls use the subprocess Git inspector and the existing bot identity client. No-change validation reads the dispatcher-owned task fields rather than worker-writable Git configuration.

Added regressions:

1. PR head SHA mismatch is rejected;
2. PR head branch mismatch is rejected;
3. PR base branch mismatch is rejected;
4. a syntactically valid but nonexistent PR URL is rejected;
5. `repository_changes=false` is rejected when the clean branch is ahead of its assigned base;
6. the exact canonical PR identity remains accepted.

Red evidence: the five rejection scenarios completed successfully before the policy change, and the happy path never called the injected GitHub client. Focused green result after the change: **7 passed, 0 failed**.

Affected-file verification:

```text
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/tools/test_kanban_tools.py \
  tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_worktree_isolation.py \
  tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_worktree_teardown.py \
  tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_worktree_unicode_path.py
```

Result: **69 passed, 2 failed**. All 52 Kanban tool tests, both worktree-isolation tests, and all 14 worktree-teardown tests passed. The two macOS Unicode-path tests failed during their own repository setup because the isolated runner had no Git author identity (`fatal: empty ident name`), before reaching changed production code. The remaining Unicode-path test passed.

After moving the assigned base into dispatcher-owned task columns, an expanded schema run produced **146 passed, 4 failed, 2 skipped** across the full Kanban tool, worktree isolation, worktree teardown, and Kanban database files. The full tool and worktree files stayed green; 78 Kanban database tests passed. The four failures are in the separate provider-crash terminal-blocking behavior (`test_terminal_provider_exit_blocks_after_one_attempt_in_either_lane[ready]` and three provider egress/thinking variants), where current branch behavior leaves those tasks ready. They do not exercise worktree allocation, base persistence, or repository completion receipts.

No GitHub write was made or attempted in this review round.

## Final review — CLI completion boundary

The repository receipt policy now runs inside `kanban_db.complete_task`, the shared state mutation boundary used by the model tool, `hermes kanban complete`, and internal callers. The tool passes its injected GitHub/Git test clients into this boundary and preserves its retry guidance. The CLI catches `CompletionPolicyError`, prints the exact receipt rejection, returns nonzero, and leaves the task in flight.

Added a real CLI regression using a temporary Git repository and Kanban database. Before the fix, `hermes kanban complete --metadata '{"repository_changes":false}'` returned success and moved a clean ahead branch to done. After the fix, it returns 1, reports the assigned-base mismatch, and keeps the task ready.

Receipt-aware worktree lifecycle tests now provide explicit no-change metadata for clean base worktrees. Dirty worktree completion asserts the shared boundary rejects the transition and preserves both the running task and dirty checkout.
